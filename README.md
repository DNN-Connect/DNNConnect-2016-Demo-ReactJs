# Demo for DNN Connect 2016 Session on React JS by Peter Donker

This module is no more than a shell to demoonstrate React JS in a DNN 8 installation. It is not a finished module and won't do all that much. All it does is to maintain a list of users who have added themselves to a table using data entered in a Bootstrap modal. The central part are the steps used as tags in the repo. These steps are the demo given during the session.
